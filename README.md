Backup of my scripts used for my hobby projects

##### 路 PiFM_script:
This is an quick and really dirty node js script for playing an WAV file over FM frequenties with an Raspberry Pi. It serves an webpage with a start button. I used it to suprise my 5 years old son for his birthday. It uses wav_fm from https://github.com/BigNerd95/RPiRadio 


##### 路 webupdate_BKM
This is an pretty dirty bash shell script for downloading the latest Openscape Business software versions from the company webserver. It uses an already file exists check.


##### 路 dragonsubs
Simple script written in python to download subtitles in different languages for movies or tv shows using www.dragonsubtitles.com, see the script-comments to know the syntax.


##### 路 getURL
Fetch a webpage or file from windows commandline, with batchscript and JScript. Credits to the original author.
